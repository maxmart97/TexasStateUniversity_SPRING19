The projects in this repository were created using IntelliJ and deployed via a localhost Apache Tomcat server.

All files in the "web" folders of each project are what I worked on.

Our final project for this class was a web scraping project. It can be found inside my ["amazon-daily-deals-scraper"](https://github.com/maxmart97/amazon-daily-deals-scraper) repository.
